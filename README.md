# frame-extractor---three-options

Note: I wrote a optional frame extractor that take video/videos as input (inside a path) and then convert all of them to images.


This is a Python script for frame extractor in these modes: 
1- extract one frame for every n second of video 
2- extract one frame for every n frames 
3- extract n frames from every different length of input video
